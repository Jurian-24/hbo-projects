# Problem 4-9*: evaluating teacher
# The students are evaluating their teacher with the grade [1 - 10].
# If the teacher scores 10, then (s)he is EXCEPTIONAL.
# If the teacher scores [7-9], then (s)he is GOOD.
# For grades in interval [4-6], the teacher is AVERAGE.
# If the teacher scores 3 or less, then (s)he is bad.
# Make an algorithm that will input the score and the salary for the teacher.
# Then, check if the score is valid (in range [1-10]) and if not, print that the input is wrong.
# Otherwise, print what kind of a teacher (s)he is, update and print the salary according to the following formula:
# Exceptional teacher gets 15% raise.
# Bad teachers have his / her salary reduced to 85%.
# Every other type of teacher gets the raise in percentage equivalent to his / her score (e.g. grade 8 means 8% increase, grade 4 means 4% increase, â€¦)
