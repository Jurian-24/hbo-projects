'''
In an application a valid password must be a combination of digits, uppercase and lowercase letters
and only four symbols * @ ! ? .

The length of the password must not be less than 8 characters
and must not be more than 20 characters.
In case the password is not valid, the user can try maximum three times until it is validated.

Implement a Python program that asks the password of the user and checks if it is a valid password.

* Use sets and set operations to solve this problem.
